      <p class="post-text">
        Sometimes it's like i know exactly what I need to do, the next step to where I want to be but the sacrifice it requires, is a lot. I don't necessarily mean hardwork, consistentcy or one of the many things we've been told are required to be succesful, I'm talking about the littlest things that make life worth living: Mobbing with the guys, Gossiping with momcy, Gisting with my sisters or spending time with the loml(This!!!). Some would tell you that this is not what matters to them, "I'd rather have a million dollars" some would say. Truth is, I'd rather have a million dollars simply because of the comfort it buys to be able to enjoy the littlest things. In fact, scratch that, I'd rather have a billion dollars So those around me would be able to make this life whatever they wanted it to be for themselves instead of having to become what the circumstances around them forced them to become.<br /><br />

        Nowadays, I see my guys all faced with different life problems, random bursts of "Omoo" after staring into blank space for sometime, not being able to explain properly why we feel weight in our chests and how we live with that weight in our chests day to day. How one can suddenly realise that he had been thinking aloud in a public place and people didn't care to notice because everyone is going through one thing or the other and couldn't care less about the next person, "Wetin concern me". I mean think about it, you barely have enough to take care of your own needs, then there's family, you'll still think about your guys, Loyl. After all that shey na one random passerby you wan come dey reason. God Abeg. And it seems like there's no end to it, everyday a new struggle, You deal with one problem another rises./<br /><br />

        Father save us from this torment called life.<br /><br />

        Truth is, the ups and downs are what make life worth living. That feeling you get after conquering what you thought was going to be the end of you, Moving on from one bad episode to a fresh new season. These victories, little or huge are why we get up every morning and keep pushing, despite our troubles, We Move.
