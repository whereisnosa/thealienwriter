      <h2 class="sub-heading">LIFE</h2>
      <p class="post-text">It is fear<br />Every move you make<br />Every word you speak<br />The way you relate with people<br /><br />It is tiring<br />Keeping up with the facade<br />The constant smile<br />The urge to scream and just let it be over<br /><br />It is exciting<br />Knowing You can do more<br />The feeling of success<br />the pleasure in an orgasm<br /><br />It is life<br />To see the people you love leave<br />To fail and fail and fail again<br />Even without success in sight<br /><br />The honest truth is life isn't fair<br />Life is just what it is<br />Life is the experience<br /><br />- Abubakar Tobby<br /><br />So anyway, I didnâ€™t tell the boogie bear who wrote this Iâ€™d be featuring his piece on my blog but I did give him credit so I mean, thatâ€™s not piracy is it? Lmfao. Heâ€™s probably never going to read this anyway.

For the past few days, Iâ€™ve had less feelings of anxiety. I still worry a whole lot though; I just noticed I pay less attention to my surroundings. Not in a not sensitive kind of way, just not worried about what I think people are thinking. Like everythingâ€™s much quieter now and the voices are just in the background.<br /><br />

Iâ€™ve had quite a week and Iâ€™m going to share because thatâ€™s what my headline says; life. So hereâ€™s how my lifeâ€™s been going so far so good.<br /><br />

Thereâ€™s a roadblock Iâ€™ve been at for the past two months. Been fighting to get past it so I can move on to the next phase of my life, but everything seems to be working against me and everyone seems to have given up on me. I constantly pray and ask Him for directions. Accepting defeat and letting things just be the way they are because I couldnâ€™t do anything is not even an option for me. I hope one day I can look back and laugh about this; the year I almost ruined my future.<br /><br />

Yesterday my mom turned fifty. I mean yeah, itâ€™s her golden jubilee and a time for celebration but I couldnâ€™t get that number 50 out of my head. Sheâ€™s spent one third of her life on earth, so what now? How long does she have left? How long before she finally breaks down and turns into a full blown old woman? How does it feel to be fifty? While everyoneâ€™s busy celebrating, trust me to do all the unnecessary worrying. I see that sheâ€™s genuinely happy though. Her life turned out okay. Maybe not perfect and all according to her plans, but she has us and I think for her, thatâ€™s a huge accomplishment. Family.<br /><br />

I have this friend I met in school. Sheâ€™s the first friend I ever made in college, the first person I ever spoke to on campus. How we met is so clichÃ© but thatâ€™s not the point. Iâ€™d probably tell you that another time if she ever pops up again.<br /><br />

Weâ€™ve been going back and forth for almost a year now and sometime this week after an intense phone call transpired between us; the highlight being Iâ€™m a shitty friend who doesnâ€™t rate her. I gave it some serious thought andâ€¦ yes, I definitely struggle with the whole calling and checking up on people thing because I donâ€™t know, I tend to think calling people a lot is kinda irritating but I guess since I NEVER call at all I have no excuse. Of course I tried to prove a point with other factors but having extroverted friends as an introvert, you sound like a squeaky idiot when thereâ€™s an argument. So I am going to try to be a better person and a better friend henceforth. Iâ€™m beginning to understand the literal term no man is an island. Bitch, you NEED friends.<br /><br />

And now, the highlight of my whole week. I got publicly harassed for the second time in BC and to say that Iâ€™m shocked would be a lie. I never thought Iâ€™d be able to talk about this but haha here I go.<br /><br />

Late Tuesday evening, I was walking along ring road trying to board a public transport when some thug out of nowhere just slapped my ass. The shock and embarrassment was one thing but what I was particularly disgusted by was how the public reacted to it. These people laughed and joked about it. Some even told me aunty just leave him jare, he was just playing. Iâ€™m sorry what now? The driver of my bus smiled and told me not to pursue the matter because there was absolutely nothing I could possibly do about it. What a country to belong to! What a city to live in!<br /><br />

This place is full of animals and demented people. The way he just walked off while I tried to understand what the fuck just happened! And before your Nigerian mind begins to conjure up sick reasons why I let that happen to me, I wasnâ€™t provocatively dressed even though that still shouldnâ€™t be an excuse.<br /><br />

The first time that happened to me, it was broad daylight and I was walking through a bush path really close to my house. He just grabbed a boob and ran off. Iâ€™ll never forget that day. The rest of the journey home was an out of body experience; I floated home. I had serious PTSD from walking alone and avoided that path for as long as I could. I would hate to know what other crazy shit the young girls have to go through around here.<br /><br />

Letâ€™s not even talk about the bizarrest of craziest shit my friend and I stumbled upon in our second year. We were walking to class from our house when we came upon a scruffy looking man standing between the trees; but very visible to passersby. This nigga was legit jer*ing off to something he was watching on his phone. I kid you the fuck not. He was JER*ING OFF. He saw us, but didnâ€™t stop. He looked me in the eye but didnâ€™t stop. How Lord, how?<br /><br />

We ignored him and awkwardly went our way but then we came across a group of little girls and so we had to stop, wait for them to safely pass until we were sure they were safe and then we left, never to speak about it again. I donâ€™t know how these people are allowed to walk the earth freely, I donâ€™t understand how they can defy everything around them to do these things, I could never understand. I know I said Benin people arenâ€™t all the same in my previous posts but I donâ€™t know, perhaps I was wrong. Maybe thereâ€™s something in their air after all, like a virus.<br /><br />

Finally, I just want to say one final thing based on an experience I had during the week. Women, stay wicked. I donâ€™t care if heâ€™s nice to you. I donâ€™t care if heâ€™s giving you the whole world. Use fifty percent of your brain to be all mushy and shit. The rest fifty, use it as a strategic weapon for planning all the wicked shit youâ€™re going to show him if he tries to fuck with you. Cos I tell you, he WILL try to fuck with you.<br /><br />

Well, thatâ€™s that about that.<br /><br />

Lifeâ€™s really just unfolding right in front of our eyes, doesnâ€™t even care at all. Everyoneâ€™s settling down, leaving the country, changing genders, finding themselves, building multimillion dollar companies and inventing shits. Gah!<br /><br />

Well, life isnâ€™t exactly fair. It just happens to be what it is. Life is THE experience, so you know, just LIVE IT and try to enjoy the little things. Thatâ€™s really what matters in the end. (I got that from an ILLENIUM verse lol but itâ€™s true)<br /><br />

What have you been listening to all week? Me, a single verse from Kim Petras and Nickiâ€™s Alone wonâ€™t set me free; I can ride it ride it ride it all night, watch me ride it ride it ride it all night. Lmao. Sheâ€™s MOTHER!
