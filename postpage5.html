        I’ve never been this confused on how to start an article until now. I feel so nostalgic.

I started writing this blog two weeks ago but I stopped midway because I couldn’t concentrate and apparently, I can’t accurately deliver when I’m gloomy and brain dead. It’s kind of like writer’s block but worse.

Being the kind of person that likes to heavily multitask, I get into these moods so frequently. I hate it.

Anyway, back to the matter

When I think 2013, I think; Wizkid, Family, Travels, Parks. I think happy thoughts.

Twenty thirteen was such a good year for me based on everything that surrounded it personally. It was the year I discovered wizkid, the year of Goodluck Johnathan, the year I traveled to Calabar for the first time, the year I bloomed. It was also the year a 12 years old had to make a milestone decision that was either going to be catastrophic for her or create like a global achievement. Till this day, I don’t know if I made the right decision. I was just a child.

Basically, in 2013, the world was still good to everyone in a sort of way. I remembered enrolling in a new school where the boys were rooting hard for Buhari (THE CHANGE PRESIDENT) for the next election. I didn’t know much about politics but I knew there was something I didn’t like about that name being all over my government assignments. They didn’t like President Johnathan because he was peaceful. They wanted a dead as fuck tyrannic administration I guess. They got it.

Ten years later, where are we? Who are we?

Dear two thousand babies,

Buhari ruled for two tenure, BAT is our new president, The country’s a lot harder now, most of the kids we grew up with now have kids of their own, we’re still not billionaires, we’re still vigorously vibing to Wizkid, we still love Chris brown and Nicki Minaj, we’re still losing friends and making new ones, some of our mates are dead, our parents are a lot older now, our younger siblings are still quite infuriating, Jaden Smith still doesn’t know us; in fact, he’s weird now, still cute but weird. There’s more to life than watching reruns of Mara and Clara. Harley Quinn is the new Barbie, Jesus doesn’t hate us when we lie like Mrs Grace taught us in Sunday school and He didn’t come in 2018 like she said, 2go was fucking stupid, Facebook still exists and no, we didn’t die from chicken pox.

Are we happy though? I don’t know.

I read a book by Mo Gawdat that said;

“If you can afford the brain cycles to worry about the future, then by definition you have nothing to worry about right now. Right now, you’re okay.” — Mo Gawdat – solve for happy

So yeah, we’re probably not ALL happy and fulfilled YET, but we’re okay. We’re still here.

In about ten years from now when we’re in our thirties, I hope life would’ve gotten brighter. I hope we have mini clones making us happy and proud (if you want kids). I hope we would’ve gotten out of our heads to enjoy the moment and the life we created for ourselves. I hope we find happiness and love. I hope we’re all still here somehow. I hope.
