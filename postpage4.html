        Welcome to my villain girl era bitches! Who‚Äôs ready for some wickedness?

You can‚Äôt tell just by looking at me that I have an insatiable lust for wickedness and revenge. I thought I looked sweet and innocent in fact.

I recently started talking to this guy from Zimbabwe and he said my name doesn‚Äôt suit me; he said it was too heavenly ‚Äì Miracle. I didn‚Äôt know how to react to that. Then, I sent him a picture of me and he said he could tell from the blogs. Tell what? I asked. I could tell you were going to have this sombre nonchalant look, the look of a person who doesn‚Äôt give a fuck. He was right about the nonchalant and dark part. But, I do give a fuck; I just would rather not show it.

I‚Äôve gone through my childhood pictures. It‚Äôs a little suspicious mom and dad how I ended up being the only child without baby pictures. I have about three to five, whereas my siblings never run out of memories. I used to believe I was adopted at a time and that‚Äôs why I never had pictures or even memories of my childhood. Guess I looked too stern for the camera or you probably trashed them all because you didn‚Äôt want those hanging on your walls. Lmfao. Nevertheless, I forgive you.

My mom has always told me I was an angry kid who didn‚Äôt like anybody, even till this day. A neighbor once told me not to smile at him because he knew I was faking it and he was right, all I really wanted was for him to just disappear. I didn‚Äôt realize it was that obvious.

I‚Äôll never forget the day some kids ran out of the church to yell to their mom after they saw me talk for the first time; mommy! That lady can talk! I didn‚Äôt realize I appeared so dumb to people. My mom was the one who witnessed all of it and till we got home, she didn‚Äôt stop laughing.

By the way, I‚Äôm not bitter Jane. I just think too damn much. I have an unnatural habit of always wanting to understand things. If I can‚Äôt come to a logical conclusion for something utterly irrational, I‚Äôll never leave it alone. And it doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm not good at expressing things verbally. I‚Äôm learning to though, because I‚Äôve realized that I have a lot to say and a lot of people don‚Äôt like to read.

So anyway, since romance has decided to be quite stingy to my generation, I‚Äôve chosen power instead. I was studying the bible recently when it dawned on me how marriage used to be strictly transactional in those days. People married for commercial purposes, for the continuation of royal blood lines, to build empires. Fathers gave out their daughters to settle disputes and bring nations together. It was while in the marriage they had to learn to love and tolerate each other (whew! What a time to be alive. I can‚Äôt even stand my own siblings not to mention a strange man I have absolutely no feelings for). I don‚Äôt know that was probably the most reasonable thing to do back then I mean, look how the world turned out.

We‚Äôre gradually turning back to those times. So when a woman of this generation says she can‚Äôt get married to a man that isn‚Äôt made, they call her a gold digger and a wealth sucking leech. Bitch? Please. Nobody‚Äôs ready to love you if you don‚Äôt have anything positive to offer. Everyone‚Äôs got a greedy reason why they ended up with their partner and it doesn‚Äôt have to be for financial gain. Your peace is money, your relationships are money, and your health is money.

So where does love fall under all these? Something propels love and love dies just as not all plants grow on every soil.

I guess the point of this short unnecessary blog today is that I‚Äôm getting really tired of believing in ‚Äúthe right one‚Äù ‚Äúthe one for you‚Äù ‚Äúthe good man‚Äù. But at the same time I‚Äôm fed up of doing this LIFE thing on my own. God? It is so f hard.

This dude came into my territory and was yapping about how girls these days are so boring and vibeless and how they don‚Äôt know how to keep a man. Um alright vibe king.

Most of the men of my generation probably have a hit list of the women they want to hit before they settle down and even settling down isn‚Äôt a reason not to continue the challenge now is it folks? I don‚Äôt dislike men but Lord do I hate their f guts? Their animalistic hunger for sex even when you clearly want nothing sexual to do with them is disgusting.

Most girls already know what you want before you even open your mouth to speak. What about your stupid promises and lies?

Thanks, but I think I‚Äôll hold on to the what I stand to gain out of a relationship. Your partner‚Äôs supposed to teach you things and help you grow all round not the other way around. So if the relationship‚Äôs not doing any of that, what in the name of Medusa are you doing there?

I want love but I also want power. And if I can‚Äôt have both, I‚Äôm choosing power. I‚Äôd rather you did the same my loves. Haha

Rather gather all the money and connections you can in this world so your offsprings never know what it‚Äôs like to be at the mercy of an ordinary human being than fall in love with an idiot who thinks you‚Äôre just one of the plenty fishes in the sea. He can discard you whenever you‚Äôre no longer of use or appealing to him.

Sorry mom I know you taught me to love but I‚Äôll be damned if I make the same mistake you made lmfao

I have tried this love thing though, believe me. Maybe not enough times, but still. Maybe I run away at the first show of vulnerability, maybe I give up too easily, maybe I need to love and accept myself more before excepting someone else to see me. Who knows? It‚Äôs possible that I‚Äôm the problem. But we‚Äôll worry about love later or never, whatever rocks my boat.

I hope to have it all one day but I really really want to have to spit on some of these men before I die. I do.
