      <p class="post-text">
        Last week, I was recalling on some of the unpleasant and funny experiences I had back in school. Some were just so disastrously horrible that after a while, I picked up my PC and decided to postpone what I‚Äôd planned on publishing today for this instead. You‚Äôre welcome.<br /><br />

        First of all, can I just say that the Akara they sell in Benin is fuckn abnormal. The crunchiness of their Akara is just so bloody unnecessary. When I say crunchy, I don‚Äôt mean chin chin crunchiness, I mean dried kpanla fish crunchiness. For God‚Äôs sake! And most of these niggas use red oil, RED OIL! Knowing how much I loved my Akara I knew I was fucked for four years (which turned out to be six btw). Till I graduated I never found a normal Akara spot in the whole of Benin. I weep for them. They‚Äôve just been eating red stone thinking they‚Äôve arrived.<br /><br />

        So anyway, one cool evening o, Anita and I decided to smoke some loud before leaving her house for mine, which was quite a distance. We smoked two joints and booked bolt. The guy came and we boarded. Reigning babes. By this time it was already dark. We were vibing at the back, taking videos and shit for a long time until this nigga suddenly took a wrong turn. So my head had to reset. By the way, I lived in the jungle and I‚Äôd just moved there for my last year. So I was still getting familiar with the area. I told him ‚Äúoga this is not the way‚Äù. Idan say ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam I know what I‚Äôm doing‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou know what you are doing ke? I say no be the way be this boss‚Äù. Well, if you‚Äôve ever stayed in Benin you‚Äôll know that the first rule is; don‚Äôt pick a fight you‚Äôre not ready to finish lmfaooo. After much chaos, he sha turned back and followed the normal way. Obviously he started complaining about the bad road because he lost the battle. By this time my head was upside down, I couldn‚Äôt recognize the road. Anita sef no con dey help matter. She was yelling at me to wake up and shine my eye so I could direct the man. I took him through a path that was much easier for a car to pass instead of the normal extremely bad road. After driving for a while and seeing that there wasn‚Äôt much difference, this nigga stopped, turned off his engine and told us to come down. For BOLT!? We say we no dey come down oga keep driving. When I saw that this moron wasn‚Äôt gonna budge, I came down while Anita rained insults on his generation. We paid him half and he zoomed off, cursing us. Anyway, we had to trek back to the beginning of the road with our heavy bags and this road was as long as third mainland bridge. Before we got home, we had trekked the remaining loud out of our system sha. It wasn‚Äôt funny.
        <br /><br />
        Another bolt incident that happened to my baby girl Sophie. This one killed me ngl. Insanely and horridly not funny but nne, I laughed abeg because why not? She lives. After lecture I say make I dey go house now. Sophie called me when I was in the bus and told me she‚Äôs coming to my side I should wait for her. Alright baby girl but I‚Äôve already left school so worzup? She said she‚Äôd book bolt so I should wait at ring road. The sun was hot so of course I waited. Anything for less shege. I saw the bolt pass me at a roundabout so she phoned and told me to walk down a road and meet them. I walked and walked and walked and walked I no see anybody only for me to notice one small commotion in front of me. Suddenly Sophie appeared from nowhere running towards me. Lmfaooo Sophie wassup? You didn‚Äôt have to come down for me now. My guy was panting. People on the road were telling her doh (sorry) even drivers. Ahahn. What happened? She say na kidnapper. Lwkmd. The guy didn‚Äôt agree to stop for me and he told her he wanted an offline transaction. Even after she told him to end the trip he started speeding and locked the doors. What saved her was when they got to an intersection and he had to slow down for cars to pass. My nigga flew out onto the roadside and ran without looking back. The man sped away with his door open. That was when I saw her running towards me. I still wonder how she didn‚Äôt get smashed on the road. This happened in broad daylight! Anyway, we continued the shege journey with bus while traumatized lil Sophie reported the driver 50 million times on the app.

        I have to say this last bolt story abeg no vex. I was in 300 level and on my way back from a visit. It was fucking late and the journey was going to be quite long. The first red flag was that the car was dirty asf, like he was just coming from Sahara desert. And, it wasn‚Äôt even giving Uber vibes, it was giving funeral vibes. Also, the driver had to be in his early fifties or so. I was lucky to get a ride at the time and so I just entered abeg. I sat at the back cos no be my throat dem go put knife for when it‚Äôs time to jump. Oh, and also, I was in cloud 9. Everything was pretty normal until his phone rang. He kept ignoring it but the person didn‚Äôt stop calling so he plugged in his earpiece and started speaking hot yoruba. Second red flag. Why must you use earpiece? I don‚Äôt know, maybe I was just being too sensitive but I don‚Äôt really understand youruba so of course I was alarmed. I know he was sha saying something about delivering something to someone and coming home late. He said his last delivery took longer than expected. Delivery? I looked outside, everywhere was dark except for the street lights. I could count the people outside with my fingers. Careless institution took over, I couldn‚Äôt care less. I asked him who he was talking to and why he was using earpiece. I told him he was making me uncomfortable. Lmfao. Well, he said everything was alright. Everything was alright nibo? I brought out my phone and video called my friend. She told me she was about to get into the bathtub. And so? I gave her morse cold and told her to place the phone somewhere where we could both watch each other. I made it so that we gisted so loudly and I could tell I was causing a nuisance at this point. I could sense his uneasiness. Omo I watched my friend bathe, do her night rituals and dress up till he dropped me at my gate. She was already waiting for me when I got there. God is good innit?

        Have you ever done something only to realize what you‚Äôve done at the end of it, like you were under a spell? Well, well, well. If this wasn‚Äôt one of those voodoo games, I don‚Äôt know what it was. I went to the deepest part of the city, somewhere I or anyone I know have never heard of before, to see a guy for the first time. It was in the evening. I love night waka abeg. This nigga‚Äôs house had to be the only completed house in that estate. It was a new site so there was a lot of uncompleted infrastructures and buildings. You could tell it was going to be a badass estate in a few years time. A place like that, obviously there was no network, as in my bar was empty, nobody could reach me and I couldn‚Äôt reach anybody. I wasn‚Äôt even bothered by all these things until I go drag wetin dem no send me and my vision cleared. The anxiety came with full force and all the red flags became glaring asf. First of, this nigga had like three phones, there was one corner in his sitting room that looked like a modernized babalawo shrine with laptops everywhere for FaceTiming his clients. By this time I‚Äôd already eaten his food. Chimo! Jesus! Without giving it too much thought, I entered the bathroom and locked myself inside. If I was going to die, I was going to die on my own terms. I‚Äôd kill myself before anyone used my parts for anything. Locking myself even made things worse for me. I started hearing screams from the uncompleted buildings, or maybe I was just imagining them lmao. These things happen. Especially when I remembered this story a guy told me a year ago about how a girl in our school was almost killed. I knew I was dead. I tried to call my sister, I climbed the toilet seat to find network. What the fuck didn‚Äôt I try? A bar finally came on and what do you know? The fucker was asleep! I called my friend in Lagos, the moron was also asleep. Well then this is it Holy Spirit. Into your hands I commit my spirit. I took my bathe and went out. By this time, he could tell that I was going through a lot. Laugh wan kill am sha. He started pacifying me and giving me logical explanations for everything. Why he had three phones, why his number couldn‚Äôt be reached, why I saw a notification from ‚Äúwheel‚Äù on his phone (which I thought was the wheelbarrow to carrry my corpse). I thought I saw security lights in a corner so I dragged it out, it was false alarm. Idk wtf that shit was but it looked like one of the tools used in the walking dead. I saw a spade so I took it and hid under my bag. The chaos I caused that night I‚Äôm surprised he let me sleep over. Any normal human being would‚Äôve been offended. After I dragged him into the room with me, I locked the door and the windows and seized his phone. You can call me ‚Äúprincess paranoia‚Äù but I know I deserve a much better death than that. I didn‚Äôt sleep that night, I was on Netflix till 6. The next morning was when I had my peace. God is good. He didn‚Äôt kill me afterall.

        I don‚Äôt have a direction for this blog. I just wanted to share these experiences lol. Y‚Äôall be safe ü´∂üèΩ
